### 3-character number
10.0 to 99.9 are rendered as X1t, where:
* X is tens digit
* 1 is ones digit
* t is the tenths digit, rendered as a decimal point with superscript-like number
* values are rounded to the nearest tenth away from zero (1.45 renders to 1.5, -1.45 renders to -1.5)
    * can optionally be animated so that if hundredths falls within some range, the digit will alternate 
      between the lower and higher value
